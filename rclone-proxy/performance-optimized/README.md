# rclone-proxy: Performance-Optimized Setup

This directory will contain a performance-optimized setup for the `rclone-proxy` solution.

This configuration will focus on tuning `rclone` for better performance and lower latency. It will include:

-   **Caching**: Using `rclone`'s caching features to reduce requests to the backend WebDAV server.
-   **VFS (Virtual File System) Tuning**: Optimizing the VFS layer for different use cases (e.g., streaming, large file access).
-   **Increased Checkers and Transfers**: Adjusting the number of parallel checks and transfers to maximize throughput.
-   **Buffer Size**: Tuning buffer sizes to improve memory usage and performance.

Detailed instructions and configuration examples will be provided here, along with performance benchmarks.
