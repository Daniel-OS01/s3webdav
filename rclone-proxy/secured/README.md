# rclone-proxy: Secured Setup

This directory will contain a secured setup for the `rclone-proxy` solution.

This configuration will build upon the [basic setup](./../basic/) and add security enhancements, such as:

-   **SSL/TLS Termination**: Using a reverse proxy like Traefik or Caddy to provide HTTPS.
-   **Stricter Authentication**: Enforcing strong passwords and potentially integrating with other authentication providers.
-   **Firewall Rules**: Recommendations for firewall configurations to restrict access.
-   **Read-only Access**: An example of how to configure the S3 server in read-only mode.

Detailed instructions and configuration files will be provided here.
