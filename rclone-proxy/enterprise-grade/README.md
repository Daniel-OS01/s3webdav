# rclone-proxy: Enterprise-Grade Setup

This directory will contain an enterprise-grade setup for the `rclone-proxy` solution.

This configuration will focus on high availability, scalability, and observability for mission-critical deployments. It will include:

-   **High Availability**: A multi-node setup with load balancing to prevent a single point of failure.
-   **Scalability**: Instructions on how to scale the service horizontally to handle increased load.
-   **Monitoring**: Integration with Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring metrics like request latency, error rates, and throughput.
-   **Logging**: Centralized logging for auditing and troubleshooting.
-   **Backup and Disaster Recovery**: Strategies for backing up the configuration and recovering the service in case of a failure.

Detailed instructions, Docker Swarm/Kubernetes manifests, and monitoring dashboards will be provided here.
