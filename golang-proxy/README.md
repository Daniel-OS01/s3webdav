# Golang Proxy Solution

This directory contains a custom Go application for high-performance WebDAV-to-S3 translation.

Go's performance and low resource usage make it an excellent choice for building a lightweight and efficient proxy. This solution is ideal for resource-constrained environments or high-throughput use cases.

## Features

-   **High Performance**: Compiled to a single binary with low memory and CPU overhead.
-   **Low Resource Usage**: Ideal for running on small devices or in containers.
-   **Concurrency**: Leverages Go's excellent support for concurrency to handle many requests simultaneously.
-   **Customizable Middleware**: Easy to add middleware for authentication, logging, and caching.

## Components

-   **Go HTTP Server**: The core of the proxy application.
-   **WebDAV Client Library**: A library for communicating with the backend WebDAV server.
-   **S3 API Handler**: The logic for translating S3 requests to WebDAV operations.

Detailed instructions, source code, and a `docker-compose.yml` will be provided in this directory.
