# Node.js Bridge Solution

This directory contains a custom Node.js application for bridging WebDAV and S3 APIs.

This solution uses an Express.js server to create a flexible and customizable bridge that can translate S3 API calls to WebDAV requests. It's a good choice if you need to add custom logic, real-time features, or webhooks.

## Features

-   **Flexible and Customizable**: Being a custom application, you can add any logic you need.
-   **Real-time Sync**: Can be extended to support real-time file synchronization.
-   **Webhook Support**: Easily add webhooks to notify other services of file changes.
-   **AWS SDK Compatibility**: Aims to be compatible with the AWS SDK for S3.

## Components

-   **Express.js Server**: The core of the application.
-   **WebDAV Client**: A library for interacting with the WebDAV server.
-   **S3 API Layer**: The code that implements the S3-compatible API.

Detailed instructions, source code, and a `docker-compose.yml` will be provided in this directory.
