# Docker Swarm Deployment Configurations

This directory will contain stack files for deploying the WebDAV-to-S3 solutions to a Docker Swarm cluster.

Docker Swarm is Docker's native clustering solution. The files in this directory will allow you to deploy the solutions in a high-availability, scalable manner.

## Contents

-   **Stack Files**: `docker-stack.yml` files for each solution, ready to be deployed with `docker stack deploy`.
-   **Configuration Examples**: Instructions on how to manage secrets and configs in Swarm.
-   **Deployment Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for deploying and scaling the solutions on a Swarm cluster.

This directory will be populated with configurations as the solutions are developed.
