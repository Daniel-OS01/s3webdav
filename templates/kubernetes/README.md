# Kubernetes Deployment Configurations

This directory will contain Kubernetes manifests for deploying the WebDAV-to-S3 solutions to a Kubernetes cluster.

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform. The manifests provided here will help you deploy, scale, and manage the solutions in a cloud-native way.

## Contents

-   **Manifests**: YAML files for Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Ingress resources.
-   **Helm Charts**: Potentially, Helm charts will be provided for easier package management.
-   **Deployment Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for deploying the solutions to a Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, GKE, EKS, AKS).

This directory will be populated with configurations as the solutions are developed.
