# Integration Tests

This directory will contain integration tests for each of the WebDAV-to-S3 solutions.

The goal of these tests is to ensure that each solution is working correctly and is compatible with the S3 API. The tests will cover common S3 operations such as:

-   `ListBuckets`
-   `CreateBucket`
-   `DeleteBucket`
-   `ListObjects`
-   `PutObject`
-   `GetObject`
-   `DeleteObject`
-   `HeadObject`

## Testing Framework

The tests will be written using a standard testing framework and an S3 client library (e.g., `boto3` for Python, AWS SDK for Go/Node.js).

## How to Run Tests

Instructions on how to run the tests for each solution will be provided in this directory. This will typically involve running a script that starts the Docker containers for the solution and then executes the tests against the S3 endpoint.

This directory will be populated with tests as the solutions are developed.
