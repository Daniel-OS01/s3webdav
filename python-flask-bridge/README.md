# Python Flask Bridge Solution

This directory contains a Python-based solution for bridging WebDAV to S3, using the Flask web framework.

This solution is a good choice for those who are familiar with the Python ecosystem. It uses the `boto3` library to help ensure S3 compatibility and can be extended with features like asynchronous tasks and database-backed metadata management.

## Features

-   **Python Ecosystem**: Easily integrate with other Python libraries and tools.
-   **Boto3 Integration**: Leverage `boto3` for S3 compatibility.
-   **Async Support**: Can be configured with a worker queue (e.g., Celery) for background sync jobs.
-   **Database Backend**: Can be extended to use a database for metadata management, caching, or audit logging.

## Components

-   **Flask Application**: The web server that handles S3 API requests.
-   **WebDAV Client**: A Python library for interacting with the WebDAV server.
-   **Boto3-compatible Layer**: The code that implements the S3 API.

Detailed instructions, source code, and a `docker-compose.yml` will be provided in this directory.
