# Caddy WebDAV to S3 Solution

This directory contains solutions for bridging WebDAV to S3 using the Caddy server.

Caddy is a modern, powerful, and easy-to-configure reverse proxy that can be extended with plugins to support WebDAV and S3-compatible APIs.

## Features

-   **Automatic HTTPS**: Caddy automatically provisions and renews SSL/TLS certificates.
-   **Easy Configuration**: Caddy's configuration file format (the Caddyfile) is simple and intuitive.
-   **Extensible**: Can be extended with custom plugins for S3 API compatibility.

## Configurations

-   **Basic Setup**: A `Caddyfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for a basic WebDAV proxy.
-   **S3 Plugin Configuration**: Instructions on how to use or build Caddy with S3-compatible plugins.
-   **Custom Builds**: Dockerfiles for creating custom Caddy builds with the necessary plugins.

Detailed instructions will be provided in this directory.
