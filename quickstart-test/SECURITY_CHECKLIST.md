# Basic Security Checklist

This checklist provides a few basic security recommendations for your generated deployment.

-   [ ] **Secure the `.env` file**: This file contains your S3 gateway credentials. Ensure it is not publicly accessible and has restrictive file permissions.

-   [ ] **Secure the `rclone.conf` file**: This file contains your WebDAV backend credentials. The password is currently in plain text.
    -   **Action**: For better security, regenerate this file using the `rclone config` command. This will encrypt your password.

-   [ ] **Review Network Exposure**: The service is exposed on port 8080 on your host machine. Ensure that your firewall rules are configured to restrict access to this port to only trusted IP addresses. For production use, you should place this service behind a reverse proxy like Traefik or Caddy to handle HTTPS.

-   [ ] **Use Strong Credentials**: Ensure the S3 and WebDAV credentials you are using are strong, unique, and not easily guessable.

-   [ ] **Regularly Update**: Keep Docker, Docker Compose, and the `rclone/rclone` Docker image up to date to receive the latest security patches.
